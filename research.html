<p>How can we better understand the most complex phases a star goes through and how can we better use our understanding of stars to understand nearby galaxies and beyond?

I use observations of resolved stellar populations to constrain stellar evolution models. My focus is on phases that have the greatest impact on galaxies but that we understand the least. So far, that's been the luminous core helium fusing phase (contained within the blue or red supergiant phase), asymptotic giant branch stars, and stars that have failed to become AGB stars.

<p>When stars between about 1.75 and 20 times the mass of the Sun fuse helium, their surface temperatures change dramatically. They start at about 4,000 K rise to 25,000 K and then head back down again, while keeping a nearly constant luminosity. In other words, star moves from being mostly reddish to white hot blue in around 20,000 years (that's fast for a star). What's even stranger, is that stars pause on each extreme temperature edge. A galaxy full of them will have two nearly vertical plumes when we plot the stars brightness against its temperature.
</p>
<p>These Helium burning sequences are import to understand because they are evidence of recent star formation. The fainter the sequence is, the older the population of stars are. In other words, they can trace the linage of stars that formed in the last 15 to 500 million years.
</p>
<p>Helium fusing stars are also important because on the blue sequence, they could be confused with the main sequence (hydrogen fusing stars) and on the red sequence, they could be confused with red giant and asymptotic branch stars, especially in galaxies so distant we cannot resolve individual stars.
</p>
<p>All that said, stellar evolution models have a hard time reproducing this temperature loop. It's very difficult to for stellar evolution models to produce these Helium burning sequences.   My research focuses on using observations of Helium Burning stars to constraining stellar evolution models.

<p>"Color-magnitude" diagrams of the galaxy Sextans A. Each dot represents a star imaged by the Hubble space telescope (contours are where the highest density of stars are).
</p>
<p>The diagram can be read with the horizontal axis being related to temperature (left side is hotter and right side is cooler) and the vertical axis being related to brightness (bottom is fainter and top is brighter).
</p>
<p>Helium burning sequences are overlaid in blue and red, next to the main sequence which is in green. The final image shows three lines.
