        <h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I am a Principal Research Program Manager within Microsoft Research Health Futures where I work at intersection of machine learning and biology and life sciences and lead teams to strategize, scope, negotiate, and instantiate research collaborations.
</p>
<p>I’m a lead of MSR’s Undergraduate Research Internship program, a program for early career researchers who are passionate about technology and offer diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>Prior to MSR, I was an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, a postdoctoral researcher at the Universita degli studi di Padova, and I earned a PhD in astronomy from the University of Washington. While at the UW, I was an MSR PhD intern and helped to build the first digital planetarium to project WorldWide Telescope (opens in new tab). Later, I directed the WorldWide Telescope program for the American Astronomical Society.      </p>
