        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Phil Rosenfield is a NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He uses the Hubble Space Telescope to observe stars in other galaxies in order to constrain stellar evolution models. His focus is on phases of stellar evolution that have the greatest impact on galaxies, but that are least understood.<br></p>
        
        <p>Besides astrophysical research, Phil creates and engages in educational programs that teach science while combating the exclusion of people based on gender, race, economic status, and disability. While at the University of Washington, he was part of the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program, co-created a program to train PhD students to communicate their research to the public, helped create affordable planetariums, and co-created a planetarium outreach program for Seattle Middle and High Schools. He is currently working with the WorldWide Telescope ambassador program to create affordable digital planetariums in the Boston area.</p>
