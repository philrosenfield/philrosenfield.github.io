        <h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Prior to leaving academia, I was an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain, in a fully probabilistic framework, uncertain physics in stellar evolution models. Prior to the CfA, I was a postdoctoral researcher a the Universita degli studi di Padova, and earned a PhD in astronomy from the University of Washington. During graduate school, I was an MSR intern, and helped build the first digital planetarium to project WorldWide Telescope. Later, I directed the WorldWide Telescope program for the American Astronomical Society. I have taught astronomy, science communication, science teaching pedagogy, software engineering skills to scientists, and have been deeply involved in inclusion and equity programming.<p>
