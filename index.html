        <h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I am a senior research program manager at Microsoft Research, based in Cambridge Massachusetts. The lab is pursuing new, interdisciplinary areas of research that bring together core computer scientists and social scientists to understand, model and enable the computing and online experiences of the future.</p>

<p>Prior to MSR, I was an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain, in a fully probabilistic framework, uncertain physics in stellar evolution models. Prior to the CfA, I was a postdoctoral researcher a the Universita degli studi di Padova, and earned a PhD in astronomy from the University of Washington. During graduate school, I was an MSR intern, and helped build the first digital planetarium to project WorldWide Telescope. Later, I directed the WorldWide Telescope program for the American Astronomical Society. I have taught astronomy, science communication, science teaching pedagogy, software engineering skills to scientists, and have been deeply involved in inclusion and equity programming.<p>
        <h3> Facutly Application Materials </h3>
        <p>Here are application materials I used for astronomy or physics faculty applications. I should state some statistics as a caveat: I applied to only 4 positions and got one interview (two searches were canceled, but I didn't stand much of a chance anyway; the interview went very well, but they ended up going with a physicist since the small physics department already had two astronomers). I was exteremely selective because I was optimizing on location (non stop flight to family) and school type (non-PhD granting).<p>
